# Project Winter
Project Winter is a very basic implementation of an HTTP server. The project's name is inspired by the popular [Spring](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework) framework

It doesn't have any specific features and was built solely to demonstrate the [Chain of Responsibility](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility) design pattern.
